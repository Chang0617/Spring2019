# PSTAT 134/234: Statistical Data Science

**Instructor:** Sang-Yun Oh

**Prerequisites:**
- PSTAT 134: PSTAT 120B and PSTAT 10 with a minimum grade of C or better, and one course from Computer Science 8, or 16 or Engineering 3
- PSTAT 234: PSTAT 126 or equivalent (regression analysis) and CS 8, or CS 16, or Engineering 3, or equivalent (intro programming course)

**Catalog description:** Overview and use of data science tools in Python for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, reproducible research and automated report generation. Case studies will illustrate practical use of these tools.  This new course will focus on concepts that are relevant for data science by using some of the popular software tools in this area. Doing data science is more than using isolated methods. Creatively using a collection of concepts and domain knowledge is emphasized to clean, transform, analyze, and present data. Concepts in data ethics and privacy will also be discussed. Case studies will illustrate real usage scenarios.

**Programming experience:** This course is designed for students with a solid conceptual understanding of programming primitives (e.g., flow control, functions, arrays, data types) and is comfortable in at least one programming or scripting language (C/C++, R, Python, etc.).

**Software tools:** Many software tools are used for data science. Tools we will use for this course include (but not limited to)
- Python
- Command line tools 
- Statistical/machine learning libraries
- Notebook software for reproducibility
- Interactive visualization in the web browser.

Learning by doing will require searching/reading software documentation, experimenting by trial-and-error, and debugging.

**Enrollment:** 
- **PSTAT 134**: Through GOLD. Waiting lists will be processed by PSTAT office
- **PSTAT 234**: Through application found here: [https://goo.gl/forms/vFsSCOK9FjnlVuCd2](https://goo.gl/forms/vFsSCOK9FjnlVuCd2) (Applications received by March 10 will be given priority)

**INT 15: Data Science Principles & Techniques (Spring 2019)**
Students that do not need to take PSTAT 134 or 234 to fulfill degree requirements are encouraged to consider a similar course offered as INT 15. The course will be co-taught by CS and PSTAT faculty members. More information can be found here: [https://ucsb-int15.github.io/](https://ucsb-int15.github.io/)
